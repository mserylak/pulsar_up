This repository contains a set of Perl scripts written
by Vlad Kondratiev and modified by Maciej Serylak:
+ jd.pl
+ sid.pl
+ azza.pl
+ azlst.pl

A Bash wrapper script:
+ pulsar_up.sh
utilises Perl scripts to aggregate output of a position
of a source of interest, at desired UTC and/or LST for
desired position of the observer.
